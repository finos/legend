Discover, access and re-use existing models, classes, mappings, runtimes, functions. Recommend a way for others to access your models, classes, mappings, runtimes, functions, and share helpful information about your data with consumers.

## Connect model to model

Connect your model to another model to de-duplicate modeling efforts and use recommended datasets and models. Transform, re-use and refine data models. Re-use classes, mappings, and runtimes that make sense for your data model.
