## Connect your data model to data

Connect your data model to data and build a service on top of it to start querying.

### Connect your data model to a relational data store

See the [relational mapping](../tutorials/studio-relational-mapping.md) and [relational test data](../tutorials/studio-create-test-data.md/#relational) tutorials.

### Define how your datasets are transformed and stored

See the [dataset transformation and storage](../tutorials/studio-define-dataset-transformation-storage) tutorial.

### Connect your data model to an API (Service store)

See the [service store](../tutorials/studio-servicestore) tutorial.

### Import a database schema and model it in Studio

See the [database schema import](../tutorials/studio-import-database-schema.md) tutorial.

### Review available unit tests to understand Legend/PURE grammar functionality

See the [unit test](../tutorials/studio-unit-tests) tutorial. 

## Connect your data model to another model

Connect your model to another model to de-duplicate modeling efforts and use recommended datasets and models. 

See the [model-to-model mapping](../tutorials/studio-m2m-mapping) tutorial.

### Find an existing project to make edits to the data model

See the [model discovery](../tutorials/studio-find-models.md) tutorial.

### Add a project/data model dependency to your data model and resolve project dependency conflicts

See the [project dependency](../tutorials/studio-project-dependencies.md) tutorial.

### Re-use classes, mappings, and runtimes that make sense for your data model

See the [model discovery](../tutorials/studio-find-models.md) tutorial.

### Re-use transformation logic as part of your mappings or services by defining a customized function

See the [function definition](../tutorials/studio-define-function.md) tutorial.
