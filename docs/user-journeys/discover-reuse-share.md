Discover, access and re-use existing models, classes, mappings, runtimes, functions. Recommend a way for others to access your models, classes, mappings, runtimes, functions, and share helpful information about your data with consumers.

## Discover and re-use/consume

- Find an existing project to make edits to the data model
- Re-use classes, mappings, and runtimes that make sense for your data model
- Connect your model to another model to de-duplicate modeling efforts and use recommended datasets and models.
- Add a project/data model dependency to your data model and resolve project dependency conflicts 
- Re-use transformation logic as part of your mappings or services by defining a customized function
