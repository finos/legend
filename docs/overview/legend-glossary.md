This page provides an overview of Data modeling concepts. See [Legend features](../overview/legend-features.md) for an overview of Legend features.

## Class

Classes define business concepts.

[Create a class](../tutorials/studio-class.md)

## Constant

Constants are static values set to a variable name that can be leveraged within your query. They remain the same for all query executions. 

## Constraint

Constraints are governance tools added on top of quality controls. Use constraints to define a validation or condition on the model that's expected to be met.

[Add a constraint](../tutorials/studio-class.md/#constraint)

## Data model

Data models allow you to describe your data and data relationships. 

## Data type

_Coming soon._

## Derived property

Derived properties use functions to operate on other attributes in the data model.

[Create a derived property](../tutorials/studio-class.md/#derived-property)

## Diagram
 
Diagrams are visual representations of data models to better visualize and communicate about data and their relationships.

[Create a diagram](../tutorials/studio-diagram.md)

## Enumeration

An enumeration is a model attribute that has a finite list of values.

[Create an enumeration](../tutorials/studio-enumeration.md)

## Functions

Functions are used to derive new values from existing values using various operations.

## Milestoning

_Coming soon._

## OLAP

_Coming soon._

## Query parameters

Parameters are variables assigned to your query. They are dynamic in nature and can change for each execution.

## Property

Properties are components of classes that define the attributes of a business concept. Properties can be both primitives (like strings or integers) or other properties. Use properties in a class to define attributes of the business concept.

[Create a property](../tutorials/studio-class.md/#property---non-primitive-data-type)


## Relational database

_Coming soon._

## Stereotype

Stereotypes allow you to extend metadata information about a model.

[Create a stereotype](../tutorials/studio-class.md/#class-stereotype).

## Super type

Super types show a relationship between classes or business concepts within a model. 

[Create a super type](../tutorials/studio-class.md/#supertype).
