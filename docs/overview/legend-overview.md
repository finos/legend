Legend is a data platform that provides a consistent and easy way to find, access and share data while ensuring data quality by design. Data Models describing and connecting data into a graph of information build the foundation to power all things data.

## Legend Products

### Legend Studio

Legend Studio is a data model editor that allows you to describe, connect, and visualize your data.

### Legend Query

Legend Query enables users to access modelled data in Legend, using a hosted graphical, drag-and-drop, self-service user interface. 

### Legend Services

Legend Services can be used to share high quality data reliably with other applications via APIs. Any self-service query can be promoted to a production-quality Legend service, fully backed by SDLC.

### Legend Engine

Legend Engine is the execution engine for Legend.

### Legend SDLC

The Legend SDLC Server provides a rich REST API allowing users to safely manage metadata. Most SDLCs are file- and text-centric, but the Legend SDLC is model-centric. That is, users interact with model entities rather than with files and folders.
