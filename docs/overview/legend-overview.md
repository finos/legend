Data is at the core of today's business processes. It must be seamlessly exchanged and understood both within a firm and across organizations. Legend aims to eliminate many of the challenges with data management today in an efficient, secure, and governed manner and remove barriers created by business silos and complex processes.

## Legend Components

### Legend Studio

Legend Studio is a data model editor that allows you to describe, connect, and visualize your data in business terms.

### Legend Query

Legend Query enables users to ask informed questions about Legend Studio data models, using a hosted graphical, drag-and-drop, self-service UI. 

### Legend Engine

Legend Engine is the execution engine for Legend.

### Legend SDLC

The Legend SDLC Server provides a rich REST API allowing users to safely manage metadata. Most SDLCs are file- and text-centric, but the Legend SDLC is model-centric. That is, users interact with model entities rather than with files and folders.
