## Released Features

### User experience improvements

**Access Studio documentation via the new virtual assistant.** You can launch the _virtual assistant_ at any point in time via the newly introduced "help" menu option. Here, you can search for key concepts that you're interested in, such as "what is a class". The _virtual assistant_ then provides you with links to relevant documentation. In addition, contextual help is available to you while navigating the Studio interface. Unsure how to write a constraint? The _virtual assistant_ will give you a visual clue that helpful documentation is available to you. You can turn off the _virtual assistant_ any time if you're already a Studio pro.

**Share Studio projects with others.** Instead of having to copu the URL of a Studio project to share it with others, you can now just click on the 'share project' button in the Project Details view.
