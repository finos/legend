## Released Features

### Alloy Query

**New Landing Page for Alloy Query.** Want to dive right into querying your data from any given taxonomy node or data space? Wait no more and check out the new Alloy Query Landing page. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1565).

**Simplified Query Editor for business users.** When you're staring your query from a data space, you will see the data space (which you can change at any point in time), the recommended execution context and the class. We are not displaying unnecessary technical execution details anymore (Mappings & Runtimes) 

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1457).

**Promote an ad-hoc query to a service.** We added an SDLC supported path to promote an ad-hoc query to a service. 

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1506).

**Load a new query directly from the Query Editor.** No need to navigate to the Landing Page anymore, you can load a new query directly from the Query Editor. 

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1436).

**Warnings for stale query results.** You are now getting warnings when your query results are stale after changing query parameters. 

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1456).

**Optimized real estate in the Query Editor.** Did you have problems navigating more complex property trees? Rest assured, we optimized the Query Editor "real estate" to make it easier for you to focus on and navigate things that matter - like the dependency tree!

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1457).

**Visual indication of already used properties.** Spot properties you already used in your query more easily. We added a visual cure (that can be switched on and off) in the property tree. 

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1367).

**Load data space much faster.** No long load times anymore! Start querying your data via data spaces in the blink of an eye, even if the underlying data model is complex. 

### Class Editor

**Visual help to identify element types.** You can now distinguish more easily what element type you're looking at in the Class Editor drop down (e.g. system vs. dependent classes).

More details [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1370).

### Customized functions

**Support of functions with the same name but different parameters (function overload).** You can now create functions with the same name but different parameters. 

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1339).

### Connection Editor

**Form Mode for Basic Post Processor.** You can now add and edit post-processors to you relational database connections in the form mode to further simplify model connectivity to Lake datasets. 

More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1481).
