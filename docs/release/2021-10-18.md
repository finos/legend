### Diagram Editor

**Build data models entirely from the Diagram view**. This includes creating classes, adding attributes and defining data relationships. This unlocks a more intuitive and collaborative way to create data models. Find out more [here](https://legend.finos.org/docs/studio/create-diagram)
