## Released Features

### Query editor

**Toggle between light & dark theme.** Don't like the dark theme in Alloy Query? Just click on the light bulb icon on the top right corner and you will see the Query Editor in light theme. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1388).

**Type-ahead for filter and post-filter.** We now support fuzzy search & type-ahead for filter and post-filter. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1381).

**Notification upon exiting Query Editor.** No more accidental loss of query edits when exiting the Query Editor. There will now be a pop up asking you if you would like to exit the Query Editor without saving your query. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1278).

**Action nodes in property tree are muted by default.** Action nodes in the property tree such as "preview data" or reviewing the data type and multiplicity of a selected property are now muted by default. They will be highlighted once hovering over them. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1338).

**Post-filter enhancements.** We made a few enhancements to the post filter: 1) cannot hide post filter when properties are added to the filter, 2) disable post filter in graph fetch ode, 3) warn users that post filter changes will be lost when switching from projection to graph fetch, 4) restrict removing of properties when selected in post filter, and 5) type compatibility checks. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1314).

**Validations when adding query parameters.** We added more validations upon creation of query parameters such as not allowing duplicate parameter names or empty names. More details [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/issues/1269).

**Showing deprecated classes as strikethrough.** If you add the "deprecated" stereotype, it will now show as strikethrough in the property tree. More details [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1310).

**Associations not resulting in classes showing recursively anymore.** Parent classes of associations won't show recursively anymore in the property tree. More details [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1180).

**Cancel queries while running.** You can now cancel queries while they're running in the Query Builder as well as in the Service & Mapping Editor. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1358).

**Drag columns from projection to filter panel.** Drag & drop properties from the projection into the filter panel. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1350).

**Running and exporting invalid queries now blocked.** We're not allowing to run or export queries anymore that are invalid - such as when no properties or duplicate properties are selected. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1359).

**Alert users when switching between graph & projection panel.** You're now warned when switching between the graph fetch & projection panel to not lose changes accidentally. More details and **video walkthrough** [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1383).

### Class Editor

**Re-arrange sub-elements.** You can now re-arrange sub-elements of classes (e.g. properties, tagged values) easily via drag & drop. More details [here](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/pull/1395).
