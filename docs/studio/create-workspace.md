## Create a workspace
Start working on your data model by creating a workspace. A workspace is a copy of a project which can be later merged back into the main project. It represents a branch in the underlying GitLab project. To create a workspace:

1. Select an existing (GitLab) project or select **+** to start working on a new one. Please note that the FINOS hosted version of [Legend Studio](https://legend.finos.org/studio/-/setup) does **not** support creating a new project at this time. 

2. Create a workspace.

3. Click **Next.**

## Create a group workspace
There is also the option to create a **group workspace** which allows collaboration on the same workspace. Changes made in this workspace are visible to other users without the need to merge to master.

1. Follow steps above to create a workspace

2. Check the **Group Workspace** check box.
