Legend provides an execution feature to run queries, constraints, and model-to-model/model-to-database transformations. Use live data (pulled from physical data stores) or generated sample data as inputs to the executions and review the results to test your model as you build it.  

You can save these tests and continue to enhance your data models with the comfort that your changes can be tested against expected results.  

## Steps to execute a model-to-model mapping

1. Drag the **Execute** panel up from the bottom of Studio screen.

2. Select the edit button to select the `NewPerson` class for testing. Then select the attribute(s) to test. The source model is auto-populated.

3. Execute the mapping and review the results.

4. Save this exection as a test to run as part of the pipeline.
