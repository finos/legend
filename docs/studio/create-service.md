## Create a new service (beta)
Build services on top of data queries to consume modeled data systematically. To create a service select **New Service** from the drop down menu to launch the **Service Editor**. Please note that the Service Editor is still in beta state and some features may not be fully available yet.

### General Tab

In the **General** tab of the Service Editor, users can specify metadata of their service including URL, documentation and owners. URL parameters can be directly defined within the {} sytnax.

### Execution Tab
