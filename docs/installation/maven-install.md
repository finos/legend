The Legend platform has five components. The minimum required to run Legend are Engine, SDLC, and Studio. The five components are:

- **Engine**: Provides a Pure parser and compiler that executes plans when provided with a Pure function, a mapping, and a runtime. It's also an access point for model transformers written using the Legend language.
- **SDLC**: Provides a rich REST API letting users manage metadata. Most SDLCs are file and text-centric, but the Legend SDLC is model-centric, meaning users interact with model entities rather than with files and folders. The Legend SDLC enables:
  - Users to develop with tools designed for editing models (rather than files or code).
  - Users to view changes with tools designed for viewing model-level changes (rather than text changes).
  - Clients to create their own tools for their own use cases.
- **Studio**: Provides a way to describe and connect data in business terms to create data models.
- **Pure**: Provides a way to alter Pure, the underlying language for Legend.
- **Shared**: Provides shared code used across Legend apps for universal server-side functionality, like hosting static files, performing authentication, and so on.

## Prerequisites

- A GitLab.com account or your own GitLab server.

  Create an _Application_ by navigating to `User Settings > Applications` and create an application with the following parameters:

  - Name: Legend Demo
  - Enable the "Confidential" check box
  - Enable these scopes: openid, profile, api
  - Redirect URI: Add the followings:

```sh
http://localhost:7070/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:7070/api/pac4j/login/callback
```

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later.
- Maven 3.6 or later.

## Installation steps

### Setup **legend-engine**.

From the root directory of the `legend-engine` repo, follow the steps below in order:

```sh
mvn install [-DskipTests]
```

```sh
java -cp legend-engine-server/target/*-shaded.jar org.finos.legend.engine.server.Server server legend-engine-server/src/test/resources/org/finos/legend/engine/server/test/userTestConfig.json
```

Test by going to http://localhost:6060 in a browser. The Swagger page can be accessed at http://localhost:6060/api/swagger.

### Setup **legend-sdlc**.

Create a configuration file based on your particular environment. This can be JSON or YAML.

A [sample configuration file](https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc/blob/master/legend-sdlc-server/src/test/resources/config-sample.yaml) is included to help you get started. You need to supply some information, like the host your server is running on and Gitlab instance your SDLC server is pointing at.

From the root directory of the `legend-sdlc` repo, follow the steps below in order:

```sh
mvn install [-DskipTests]
```

```sh
# Make sure to replace <path-to-config>
java -cp legend-sdlc-server/target/*-shaded.jar org.finos.legend.sdlc.server.LegendSDLCServer server <path-to-config>
```

Test by going to http://localhost:7070/api/info in the browser. The page should return basic server information.

Visit http://localhost:7070/api/auth/authorize in your browser, you might get redirected to the Gitlab login page or a Gitlab page that askes you to authorize Legend application. After you authenticate/authorize you should be redirected back to SDLC.

### Setup **legend-depot**.

Follow this [guide](https://github.com/finos/legend-depot/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) on how to start local Depot.

### Setup **legend-studio**.

Follow this [guide](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) on how to start local Studio.


### You're all set :tada:
