## Create a new Diagram

A diagram is like a canvas where you can add any model elements. A Diagram helps you to define your classes and relationship between them.
It is a very convenient way to pictorially display your model.  

To create a new Diagram:

1. Click <kbd>+</kbd> and then select <kbd>New Diagram</kbd>.
2. Provide a meaningful name to your diagram and start adding new elements to the diagram.   

In the [Logical Modeling (Basic) showcase project](../showcases/showcase-projects.md/#logical-modeling-basic), TradeAccountDiagram is the diagram which shows the model.
