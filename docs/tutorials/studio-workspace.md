## Workspace

Start working on your data model by creating a [workspace](../concepts/legend-concepts.md/#workspace). A workspace is a copy of a project which can be later merged back into the main project. It represents a branch in the underlying GitLab project. To create a workspace:

1. Select an existing (GitLab) project or select <kbd>+</kbd> to start working on a new one. Please note that the FINOS hosted version of [Legend Studio](https://legend.finos.org/studio/-/setup) does **not** support creating a new project at this time.

2. Create a workspace.

3. Click <kbd>Next</kbd>.
