## Workspace

Start working on your data model by creating a [workspace](../overview/legend-features.md/#workspace). A workspace is a copy of a project which can be later merged back into the main project. It represents a branch in the underlying GitLab project. To create a workspace:

1. Select an existing (GitLab) project or select <kbd>+</kbd> to start working on a new one. Please note that the FINOS hosted version of [Legend Studio](https://legend.finos.org/studio/-/setup) does **not** support creating a new project at this time.

2. Create a workspace.

3. Click <kbd>Next</kbd>.

## Group workspace

There's no need to merge changes in your workspace to master to make them visible to others. Group workspaces allow for easier collaboration in community driven projects.
