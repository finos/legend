## Review and commit changes

Legend is integrated with the software development lifecycle (SDLC) supported by GitLab, which lets you review and commit changes.

Follow these steps to review and commit a change.

1. Press `Ctrl+S` to sync the local changes to the workspace.

3. To create a review, click the highlighted icon in the activity bar or press `Ctrl + Shift + M` to go to the review panel. Here you can review the code in the current workspace vs. the committed code.

## Update workspace with latest changes

When the workspace is out of date, Studio provides a notification in the status bar on the bottom left. Click the update button on the sidebar to bring in the latest changes.

## Resolve a conflict in the workspace

A workspace update may result in a conflict. Studio will open a new view to aid in resolving the conflict.

1. Choose one of the following actions:

   - **Discard the changes**: the workspace changes are removed.

   - **Review the changes**: the workspace changes will be applied on top of the latest version.

3. Once the changes compile successfully, either accept or discard the changes.
