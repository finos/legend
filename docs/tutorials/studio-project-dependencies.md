## Define project dependencies

When you add a [project dependency](../concepts/legend-studio-concepts.md/#project-dependencies), all its dependencies are included as well. For example, if model $A$ creates a dependency on "Listed Product", and "Listed Product" depends upon the "Foundation" model, you _do not_ need to add a separate dependency to Foundation for model $A$ to depend on it. The dependency is already included in your dependency to other projects.

## Dependency version control
