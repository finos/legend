## Start Using Legend Today

### Studio hosted instance

This is the easiest way to get started with Legend as it does not involve any installation steps. 

FINOS hosts a free instance of Legend to be used for shared modeling efforts. 

Instructions to sign up and use this instance are available on the [FINOS website](https://www.finos.org/legend).

**Note: This is a shared instance which might not be appropriate for proprietary data models.**

### Install your own Legend

See the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation-guide.md) for details.
