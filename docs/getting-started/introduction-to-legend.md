## Start Using Legend Today

There are multiple ways to get started with Legend: getting access to the Studio hosted instance, using Legend Omnibus to get the Legend environment up and running locally, or installing Legend.

### Studio hosted instance

This is the easiest way to get started with Legend as it does not involve any installation steps.

FINOS hosts a free instance of Legend to be used for shared modeling efforts.

Instructions to sign up and use this instance are available on the [FINOS website](https://www.finos.org/legend).

**Note: This is a shared instance which might not be appropriate for proprietary data models.**

### Using Legend Omnibus

This is a quick way to get the Legend environment up and running locally. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed. Run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
curl https://legend.finos.org/omnibus/start.sh | bash

# Or run the full Omnibus (with embedded Gitlab) which might take a little longer to start up
curl https://legend.finos.org/omnibus/start.full.sh | bash
```

> For Windows user, please use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or [WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/wsl/) to run the above command.

See the [Omnibus Guide](https://github.com/finos/legend/tree/master/installers/omnibus) for more details.

### Setup your own Legend environment

This is the recommended way to setup Legend for local development. See the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation-guide.md) for details.
