_TODO: add intro paragraph, point to user journeys, showcase models, tutorials, glossary. Explain where to find what on the docs site. Consider framing this for each persona (business user vs. developer, new vs. experienced user._

## Introductory Videos

Watch the introductory Studio & Query sessions hosted by Beeke-Marie Nelke for the FINOS Open Source community:

-   [Legend 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mruhx5hnLzQ). Learn the basics of data modeling in Legend Studio.
-   [Legend New Feature Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lJoik3r38k). Learn how to create mappings and query your data.

We highly recommend reviewing the [Legend talks and conferences](../community/legend-media.md) recordings.

## Tutorials

Review the step by step tutorials for [Studio](../tutorials/studio-create-model) and [Query](../tutorials/query-tutorial.md).

## Start Using Legend Today

### Studio hosted instance

This is the easiest way to get started with Legend as it does not involve any installation steps. 

FINOS hosts a free instance of Legend to be used for shared modeling efforts. 

Instructions to sign up and use this instance are available on the [FINOS website](https://www.finos.org/legend).

**Note: This is a shared instance which might not be appropriate for proprietary data models.**

### Install your own Legend

See the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation-guide.md) for details.
