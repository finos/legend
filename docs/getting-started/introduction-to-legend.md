## Start Using Legend Today

There are multiple ways to get started with Legend: getting access to the Studio hosted instance, using Legend Omnibus to get the Legend environment up and running locally, or installing Legend.

### Studio hosted instance

This is the easiest way to get started with Legend as it does not involve any installation steps.

FINOS hosts a free instance of Legend to be used for shared modeling efforts.

Instructions to sign up and use this instance are available on the [FINOS website](https://www.finos.org/legend).

**Note: This is a shared instance which might not be appropriate for proprietary data models.**

### Using Legend Omnibus

This is a quick way to get the Legend environment up and running locally. Make sure you have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Run the following command in the terminal.

```sh
curl https://legend.finos.org/omnibus/start.full.sh | bash
```

See the [Omnibus Guide](https://github.com/finos/legend/tree/master/installers/omnibus) for more details.


### Setup your own Legend environment

This is the recommended way to setup Legend for local development. See the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation-guide.md) for details.
