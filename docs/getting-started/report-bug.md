# Report a bug

View the prerequisites and steps to report a bug by creating an issue in GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- [Search for duplicates](https://github.com/finos/legend/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=). A search for exception error messages or a summary of the unexpected behaviour is enough.
- Are you running the latest version?
- Are you sure this is a bug or missing capability?

## Create an issue in GitHub

1. Create your issue [in GitHub](https://github.com/finos/legend/issues/new).
2. New issues contain two templates in the description: bug report and enhancement request. Select the most appropriate for your issue, *then delete the other*.
3. Tag the new issue with either **Bug** or **Enhancement**.
4. Use [Markdown formatting](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) to improve readability. For example, use [code fences](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for exception stack traces and log entries.
