There are the three roles involved in the submission of model changes:

- **Modeler**: Makes the model changes.
- **Approver**: Reviews and approves the model changes in a working group. Approvals are votes in support of merging and codifying the change. Model approvers are people with knowledge of the product being modeled.
- **Merger (sometimes called a Committer)**: Has admin privileges to the GitLab repo required to merge model changes to the master version of a model within Legend. These merge privileges are granted to a few within a project or working group—usually the working group leads or systems administrators. Merge privileges can also be granted to other contributors, as decided by the working group participants.

## Model Approvals

Approvals in GitLab are similar to "likes" or "+1"s in common consumer social media platforms. Anyone except for the modeler who submitted that particular change—may give their "+1" (approval) of a change. GitLab approvals provide each working group flexibility on how they choose to develop an approval policy that works best for them.

Approval options include:

- A consensus model (one or more fellow modelers need to "+1" a change).
- A designated approver(s).
- One specific person plus any two other people within the working group.
- Some combination of these options.
