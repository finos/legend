There are a few different options to install and use Legend. They are listed below in increasing order of integration and installation complexity.

## Maven Install

This option is for software developers who want to build and run Legend from source.

### Installation Guide

The Legend platform has several components. The minimum required to run Legend are `Engine`, `SDLC`, and `Studio`. These components include:

-   **Engine**: Provides a Pure parser and compiler that executes plans when provided with a Pure function, a mapping, and a runtime. It's also an access point for model transformers written using the Legend language.
-   **SDLC**: Provides a rich REST API letting users manage metadata. Most SDLCs are file and text-centric, but the Legend SDLC is model-centric, meaning users interact with model entities rather than with files and folders. The Legend SDLC enables:
    -   Users to develop with tools designed for editing models (rather than files or code).
    -   Users to view changes with tools designed for viewing model-level changes (rather than text changes).
    -   Clients to create their own tools for their own use cases.
-   **Studio**: Provides a way to describe and connect data in business terms to create data models.
-   **Pure**: Provides a way to alter Pure, the underlying language for Legend.
-   **Depot**: Provides a metadata registry to support project dependencies and artifact publishing.
-   **Shared**: Provides shared code used across Legend apps for generic server-side functionality, such as serving static files, performing authentication, and so on.

#### Prerequisites

-   A GitLab.com account or your own GitLab server.

    Create an _Application_ by navigating to `User Settings > Applications` and create an application with the following parameters:

    -   Name: Legend Demo
    -   Enable the "Confidential" check box
    -   Enable these scopes: openid, profile, api
    -   Redirect URI: Add the followings:

```sh

http://localhost:6100/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:6100/api/pac4j/login/callback

```

-   Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later.
-   Maven 3.6 or later.

### Installation steps

#### Setup **legend-engine**.

From the root directory of the `legend-engine` repo, follow the steps below in order:

```sh

mvn install [-DskipTests]

```

```sh

java -cp legend-engine-server/target/*-shaded.jar org.finos.legend.engine.server.Server server legend-engine-server/src/test/resources/org/finos/legend/engine/server/test/userTestConfig.json

```

Test by going to http://localhost:6300 in a browser. The Swagger page can be accessed at http://localhost:6300/api/swagger.

#### Setup **legend-sdlc**.

Create a configuration file based on your particular environment. This can be JSON or YAML.

A [sample configuration file](https://github.com/finos/legend-sdlc/blob/master/legend-sdlc-server/src/test/resources/config-sample.yaml) is included to help you get started. You will need to replace some `placeholders`, such as Gitlab instance your SDLC server is pointing at.

From the root directory of the `legend-sdlc` repo, follow the steps below in order:

```sh

mvn install [-DskipTests]

```

```sh

# Make sure to replace <path-to-config>
java -cp legend-sdlc-server/target/*-shaded.jar org.finos.legend.sdlc.server.LegendSDLCServer server <path-to-config>

```

Test by going to http://localhost:6100/api/info in the browser. The page should return basic server information.

Visit http://localhost:6100/api/auth/authorize in your browser, you might get redirected to the Gitlab login page or a Gitlab page that askes you to authorize Legend application. After you authenticate/authorize you should be redirected back to SDLC.

#### Setup **legend-depot**.

Follow this [guide](https://github.com/finos/legend-depot/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) on how to start local Depot.

#### Setup **legend-studio**.

Follow this [guide](https://github.com/finos/legend-studio/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) on how to start local Studio.

#### You're all set ðŸŽ‰

Visit http://localhost:9000/studio and start hacking

## Docker Compose

This option is a more automated process to start Legend Docker images for running a proof of concept. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/finos/legend/tree/master/installers/docker-compose).

## Production Install

A production install will have to be adjusted to match your specific deployment environment. We publish Docker images, but some additional setup is required.

This includes but is not limited to:

-   Configuring SSL Certificates
-   Configuring OAuth on Gitlab
-   Configuring authentication using an identity provider

We are happy to help develop installation instructions to meet your particular deployment environment.
