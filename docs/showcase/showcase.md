# Legend Showcase

## Overview

The Legend showcase is collection of Legend projects, model snippets and applications that showcase the many features of
the Legend platform.

## Contribute

Are you looking for an example that demonstrates how to use a Legend feature ? Or the Legend documentation for this
feature was in sufficient ?

Please open an issue and/or ask for help on the project's mailing list. But also consider adding a showcase for other
users.
