## Workspace
A workspace is where you create your data models. It's a copy (also known as a branch) of a project which can be later merged back into the main project and shared with other users.

[TODO: add screenshot]

The left side tells you the name of your project and whether your workspace is up to date with your project head.

The right side has actionable icons. In order, they: Sync your workspace `(Ctrl + S)`, compile your workspace `(F9)`, toggle your screen size, toggle the auxiliary panel, and toggle grammar mode `(F8)`.

## Data Model Editor

Diagrams are visual representations of your data models. The diagram shows the relationships between business concepts. You can use the diagram to edit your models.

## Grammar Mode

Also known as Text mode, grammar mode allows you to:
- See the entirety of your workplace's code and edit your elements with ASCII text (as opposed to an interactive editor)
- Grammar mode will also parse and compile your code. If the code compiles, your GUI graph will be updated and the changes will be updated in your forms

[TODO: add screenshot]

To access or exit Grammar mode: Press `F8` or the hacker icon on the bottom right corner of your scrreen. The bar should change when you open or close Grammar mode. 

To compile your code: Press `F9`
