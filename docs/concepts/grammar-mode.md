Also known as Text mode, grammar mode allows you to:
- See the entirety of your workplace's code and edit your elements with ASCII text (as opposed to an interactive editor)
- Grammar mode will also parse and compile your code. If the code compiles, your GUI graph will be updated and the changes will be updated in your forms

[TODO: add screenshot]

To access or exit Grammar mode: Press `F8` or the hacker icon on the bottom right corner of your scrreen. The bar should change when you open or close Grammar mode. 

To compile your code: Press `F9`
