# Workspaces

A workspace is where you create your data models. It's a copy (also known as a branch) of a project which can be later merged back into the main project and shared with other users.

[TODO: add screenshot]

The left side tells you the name of your project and whether your workspace is up to date with your project head.

The right side has actionable icons. In order, they: Sync your workspace `(Ctrl + S)`, compile your workspace `(F9)`, toggle your screen size, toggle the auxiliary panel, and toggle grammar mode `(F8)`.
