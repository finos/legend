Data models allow you to describe your data and data relationships. 

## Classes

Classes define a business concept.

## Properties

Properties are components of classes that define the attributes of a business concept. Properties can be both primitives (like strings or integers) or other properties. Use properties in a class to define attributes of the business concept.

## Derived properties

Derived properties use functions to operate on other attributes in the data model.

## Tagged values

Tagged values allow you to add context to your data model. Tagged values can be added at the class level and at the property level.

## Stereotypes

Stereotypes allow you to extend metadata information about a model.

## Enumeration

An enumeration is a model attribute that has a finite list of values.

## Constraints

A data model has built-in governance features, called _data quality controls_. You create data quality controls every time you define a model. Constraints are governance tools added on top of quality controls. Use constraints to define a validation or condition on the model that's expected to be met.

## Super types

Super types show a relationship between classes or business concepts within a model. Add a super type to the model to show a hierarchical relationship between classes or business concepts.
