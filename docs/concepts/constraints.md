A data model has built-in governance features, called _data quality controls_. You create data quality controls every time you define a model. Constraints are governance tools added on top of quality controls.

Quality controls can be used to monitor all sorts of data qualities, such as:
- **Type**: ensures that the data is in the form of a string, integer, date, or other data type.
- **Multiplicity**: ensures that there are zero, one, many, or few instances of a certain piece of data.
- **Enumeration**: validates whether data entries are found in a pre-defined list (for exmaple, all U.S. states like NY, CT, NJ)
- **Other criteria**: for instance, that the name length is greater than two characters.

Constraints don't block data - they only raise exceptions.

To create a class, enumeration or profile:
1. Right-click any package on the left side of the panel, or click the `+` near the name of your project.
2. Under `Class view`, you'll see a list of class forms as well as a diagram view of your class. You can add tags, stereotypes, properties, constraints, qualified properties, and super types to your model.
