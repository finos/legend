# This line does two things:
# - enable git's CRLF -> LF modification
# - tell git to guess whether files are text or binary
*                       text=auto eol=lf

# Mark as binary to prevent git from trying to merge it
*.ico                   binary
*.png                   binary
*.jpg                   binary
