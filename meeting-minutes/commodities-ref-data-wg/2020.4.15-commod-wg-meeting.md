### Agenda item #1
* Ted to present the CDM principles
Shared slide presentation for all to refer to as we progress

### Agenda item #2
* GS to describe the problem statement we are looking to solve

Not a clear separation of contractual data v reference (price) data in the current FpML construct for Commodities
Current fPML schema restricts the information that you can give around specific commodities and not flexible to cater for new industry data demands/categorisation.
Want to agree an industry model that can be stored externally to the contractual (transactional) model however there will be dependency between the two on a contractual basis.
Improve external communication intrabank/regulation

### Agenda item #4
* Walk through of commoditySwap classes that basic Oil swap would leverage (FixedLeg v FloatLeg)

Completed a review of the  Fixed Leg and Floating Leg within the commodity FpML
https://www.fpml.org/spec/fpml-5-9-6-rec-1/html/confirmation/schemaDocumentation/schemas/fpml-com-5-9_xsd/elements/commoditySwap.html  

Question raised on whether Price and Quantity in the CDM model allow for multiple values - later confirmed by Ted.
