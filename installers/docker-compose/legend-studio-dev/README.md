# Docker Compose for Legend with remote instance of Gitlab

1. Modify the config file (you can use the template `config.properties`):

- Change the values for `HOST_DNS_NAME` and `HOST_ADDRESS` (if needed)
- Change the values for `GITLAB_URL` and Gitlab OAuth configs: `GITLAB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GITLAB_OAUTH_SECRET`.

> Note that for OAuth configs, you would need to either create a new or use an existing Gitlab OAuth application registered at `GITLAB_URL`, follow [Gitlab OAuth config setup](#gitlab-oauth-config-setup) for more details.

2. Run the setup script:

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh ./config.properties
```

> After setting up, the terminal will print proper redirect URIs for your OAuth application, so if you used a dummy redirect URL while setting up your Gitlab OAuth application, make sure to update the application with the proper redirect URLs. You should expect to see something like the following:

```sh
# This is just an example, subjected to change
http://192.168.1.100:6300/callback
http://192.168.1.100:6100/api/auth/callback
http://192.168.1.100:6100/api/pac4j/login/callback
http://192.168.1.100:9000/studio/log.in/callback
http://localhost:6300/callback
http://localhost:6100/api/auth/callback
http://localhost:6100/api/pac4j/login/callback
http://localhost:9000/studio/log.in/callback
```

3. Run the Docker compose project

```sh
docker-compose --env-file ~/legend-temp/.env up --detach
```

4. Run the application

Visit http://localhost:6100/api/auth/authorize in your browser, you might get redirected to the Gitlab login page or a Gitlab page that askes you to authorize Legend application. After you authenticate/authorize you should be redirected back to SDLC.

Next, go to [http://`HOST_ADDRESS`:9000/studio]() to launch Studio.

> Since starting Studio in development mode using the ad-hoc dev server would not get the benefit of OAuth redirection, we would need to manually go to the SDLC server to get the OAuth token.

5. Stop the Docker compose project

```sh
docker-compose --env-file ~/legend-temp/.env down
```

## Gitlab OAuth config setup

If you don't already have a Gitlab OAuth application, first, navigate to `User Settings > Applications` and create an application with the following parameters:

- Name: Legend Demo
- Redirect URI: If you don't know how to generate these, put a dummy URL for now, e.g. `http://dummy`
- Enable the "Confidential" check box
- Enable these scopes: openid, profile, api
- Finally, "Save Application"
